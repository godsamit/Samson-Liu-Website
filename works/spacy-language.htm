  <h2>ARCHITECTURE, LANGUAGE AND WORD VECTORS</h2>
    <p>Architecture professors use... <i>"weird"</i> words, from abstract terminologies like <i>"deconstruction","spatiality"</i>, to out-of-place adjectives like <i>"rectilinear","robust"</i>. No professor would hold a discussion about such language. As students, we were just supposed to take the critique and somehow understand everything. Possibly due to my constant misunderstanding, my attempts at incorporating what I read from the "masters" into my design always came up short... From my experience, such confusion with design and language is common among architecture students. Spatial experiences could be so elusive and complex that words would often fail them. But we still have to talk about them, we still have to give critiques and carry on designing.<br><br>
    Therefore, in my thesis project, I can't help but wanting to explore the connection between language and spatial experiences. Since quantitative research is rarely done in architecture due to the physical constraints, my initial thought wad to utilize <b>virtual reality</b> to try to "measure" some words. As I look into the problem and the context, I gathered some more insight from previous researches:<br><br>
    <span class="li">Scientific measurements of built environment can be done and have been done in VR, in the most <b>strict</b> and <b>simplistic</b> way possible: let participants react to a space by choosing between two polar opposite words (e.g. open/closed, narrow/spacious), or describing exactly one spatial property (e.g. ceiling height) at a time.</span>
    <span class="li">Spatial perception is highly <b>subjective</b> and language itself is intrinsically <b>ambiguous</b>. For a less extreme word, the same word would mean differently to people with different experiences. Conversely, the same space would leave different impacts as well.</span>
    <span class="li">NLP programs and machine learnings can use "word vectors" (word embeddings) as a way to interpret a word and predict the next word in a conversation. The vectors are assigned by an <a href="https://ruder.io/word-embeddings-1/index.html#anoteonlanguagemodelling" target="_blank">algorithm</a> analyzing a corpus. The word vector by itself could largely be meaningless, and would be different depending on the system. But <b>a single system is self-coherent</b>, and the relationships between words can be <a href="http://byterot.blogspot.com/2015/06/five-crazy-abstractions-my-deep-learning-word2doc-model-just-did-NLP-gensim.html?m=1" target="_blank">fairly accurately represented by vector maths between the corresponing vectors.</a></span><br>
    The first insight means that a completely objective and quantitative experiment would be very inefficient in a design environment.<br> 
    The second insight calls for emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual's language set and how it's linked to his/her spatial perception.<br> 
    The third insight, however, reveals that everyone's language pattern could be self-coherent and decodable, and even provides a means for encoding and decoding.

    <h2>PROPOSAL FOR A DESIGN TOOL</h2>
    <p>From linear algebra, we know that <b>any vector space of dimension <i>N</i> can be have a set of <i>N</i> linearly independent vectors as its basis</b>. This means that any vector within the vector space can be seen as a combination of the basis. From this, I had this "crazy" idea:<br><br>
    <b>Can I use a set of words as a basis for the vector space of word vectors?</b><br><br>
    Then, all language could be mapped onto a small set of <b>"basic words"</b>. If each "basic word" in the basis corresponds to a kind of <b>"basic space"</b>, we could potentially break down complex language to an easier combination of "basic spaces".<br><br>
    Of course, there are HUGE caveats. The nature of language is complex and ambiguous. A sentence could also often be more than its words combined. Also, words with multiple meanings are conflated into a single representation. What's more, the vector spaces of word vectors are <b>discrete</b> rather than continuous, which makes operations like scalar multiplication rather questionable. All in all, the proposed vector mapping is NOT meant to be taken as some "magic" that dumbs down the complexity of human language. It's also not meant to be a tool that could fully decode complex speech. However, due to the nature of this project being <b>design thesis</b>, rather than scientific research, I'm curious about the potential of such mappings in a design context, which is more loose. It would be interested to see what this new system could bring to the table. I believe such proposal has the following merits:<br><br>
    <span class="li">Word vectors are still fairly accurate and self-consistent. With a tested algorithm that allows for synonyms and ambiguity in the mapping, the result could still be fairly understandable.</span>
    <span class="li">It's interesting to see what the inaccuracies of mapping could bring to the table design-wise.</span>
    <span class="li">Every person will have a different and individualized vector space. This design tool could potentially help people visualize their different understandings and thusly improve communication between designers.</span><br>
    Note: Most word vector space has hundreds of dimensions. Does it mean I need to define hundreds of "basic words"? Not really. word vectors are often projected down drastically for visualization and other purposes, as I demonstrated in the diagrams. Remember in <i>N</i> dimension, you potentially only need <i>N</i> words as a base. Therefore, I could choose an arbitrary number for N, and just project the word vector space downward.</p>

    <h2>AFFORDANCE OF VR AND MESH GEOMETRIES</h2>
    <p>After the thorough discussion of methodology, I need to build a proof-of-concept prototype to serve as an example of this new design tool. From the start of the thesis, I set my eyes on <b>Virtual Reality</b>, as I thought it would be an amazing opportunity to explore this technology. What's more, it would be a great medium for a gallery exhibition.<br><br>
    At the start, I was hoping to generate typical architectural spaces. But soon I realized that such spaces are not fully utilizing the potential of VR. A digital and virtual space means that physics don't need to apply, and space itself could be way more dynamic and interactive. A prototype built in VR should face those possibilities and tackle the challenges it brings.<br><br>
    Most architects build their digital models with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline" target="_blank">NURBS geometry</a>. Such geometry is not native to most VR interfaces and would thusly require (usually manual) converting. Therefore, for the prototype, I decided to see what can I do with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh" target="_blank">mesh geometry</a> instead. After some research into Delauey, marching cubes and other mesh generation algorithms, I decided on using a procedurally generated <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rounded+cube&sxsrf=ALeKk03afjJnE2OQy4-u-Mhpcs0V_gNNOQ:1586707864586&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjt2IW1o-PoAhXGgnIEHYRuAHcQ_AUoAnoECAwQBA&biw=1600&bih=757" target="_blank">rounded cube</a> represent my "space" as it gives me more control in an architectural sense. I designed three basic operations to configure the space:<br><br>
    <span class="li"><b>"Sizing":</b> This is the most basic operation. It changes the dimensions of the cube. It calculates the planar room proportions, as well as ceiling height.</span>
    <span class="li"><b>"Blob":</b> A region on the surface of the cube. Defined by two vectors. Operations could be done to change the vertex colors, or shift the postions of all the vertices within the "blob".</span>
    <span class="li"><b>"Attractor"</b>: A point within the cube. All vertices close enough will be affected. Operations could be done to change the vertex color, or shift the positions of the "attracted" vertices.</span><br>
    For the "blob" and "attractor", aggregated classes are established for groups of blobs or attractors, for easier management. By combining the various settings of these three operations, one can start to create some genuinely bizzare and dynamic spaces. For example, one can set the position of the user as the attractor point, which makes the space to react to where the user is. <br><br>
    Despite the success it brings, such approach resulted in two shortcomings of the thesis:<br>
    <span class="li">The space it created is a little too bizzare for language. Some of the basic operations will result in spaces that are too rich to be defined by just one "basic word". The generated bizzare space also made people confused about the original intent of the thesis.</span>
    <span class="li">The current prototype utilizes word vectors generated from all the wikipedia articles. It serves well as a prototype, but I wish I could have generated word vectors from different designers' speech. However, that in itself requires more skills than I currently possess, and it is a huge amount of work. Therefore, if the thesis continues in any way, that will be the next step.</span>
