  <h2>ARCHITECTURE, SPACES AND LANGUAGE</h2>
    <p>Architecture professors use... <i>"weird"</i> words, from abstract terminologies like <i>"deconstruction","spatiality"</i>, to out-of-place adjectives like <i>"rectilinear","robust"</i>. No professor would hold a discussion about such language. As students, we were just supposed to take the critique and somehow understand everything. Possibly due to my constant misunderstanding, my attempts at incorporating what I read from the "masters" into my design always came up short... From my experience, such confusion with design and language is common among architecture students. Spatial experiences could be so elusive and complex that words would often fail them. But we still have to talk about them, we still have to give critiques and carry on designing.<br><br>
    Therefore, in my thesis project, I can't help but wanting to explore the connection between language and spatial experiences. Since quantitative research is rarely done in architecture due to the physical constraints, my initial thought wad to utilize <b>virtual reality</b> to try to "measure" some words. As I look into the problem and the context, I gathered some more insight from previous researches:<br><br>
    <span class="li">Scientific measurements of built environment can be done and have been done in VR, in the most <b>strict</b> and <b>simplistic</b> way possible: let participants react to a space by choosing between two polar opposite words (e.g. open/closed, narrow/spacious), or describing exactly one spatial property (e.g. ceiling height) at a time.</span>
    <span class="li">Spatial perception is highly <b>subjective</b> and language itself is intrinsically <b>ambiguous</b>. For a less extreme word, the same word would mean differently to people with different experiences. Conversely, the same space would leave different impacts as well.</span>
    <span class="li">NLP programs and machine learnings can use "word vectors" as a way to interpret a word and predict the next word in a conversation. The word vector by itself could largely be meaningless, and would be different in different systems. But <b>a single system is self-coherent.</b></span><br>
    The first insight means that a completely objective and quantitative experiment would be very inefficient in a design environment.<br> 
    The second insight calls for emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual's language set and how it's linked to his/her spatial perception.<br> 
    The third insight, however, reveals that each set could be self-coherent and decodable, and even provides a means to do so.

    <h2>WORD EMBEDDING</h2>
    <p>Putting the gallery close to the bridge benefited my design in the following ways:<br><br>
      <span class="li">On this deserted island, the <a href="https://historicbridges.org/bridges/browser/?bridgebrowser=pennsylvania/brunotisland/" target="_blank">Brunot Bridge</a> is one of the few prominent historical structures. It <b>enriches</b> the immediate <b>context</b>, <b>grounds</b> my proposal and <b>ties</b> it <b>to the history</b> of the island;</span>
      <span class="li">As a "water pavilion", putting it close and above water makes the experience <b>more immersive</b>, allowing for <b>more</b> ways of <b>interactions with the river;</b></span>
      <span class="li">From an <b>access</b> standpoint, it makes the building more accessible to the public, especially bikers, by connecting the existing footbridges to the bike tracks nearby. Otherwise, the island is very much secluded;
      </span>
      <span class="li">Putting the proposal out onto the river <b>increases the visibility</b> of the proposal to the public, which is crucial in this project. But since it remains in the non-barge area, it doesn't interrupt with the busy barge traffic on the Ohio River.
      </span><br>
      I moved through process models to explore the structural possibility to have a building hanging under a bridge. I worked the idea of <b>"frames"</b> into the design: A series of frames are <b>hung from the bridge</b>, lined up with the bridge's truss. These frames serve as the main structure for the building. Each frame can be <b>relatively independent</b> and they can have different shapes, Therefore, it allowed for oppotunities to create various <b>rises and gaps</b> on the floor and roof level, adding to the experience. Then, I worked on making the frames read lighter to create a bigger gallery space.</p>

    <h2>AFFORDANCES OF VR</h2>
    <p>The final design explored various experiences this unique structure can offer to visitors. <br><br>
    Inside the building, there are various <b>floor-level changes</b>. Along with the programming decisions, this design aims to create a <b>narratively meaningful spatial sequence</b> for visitors. For example, entering from the island, visitors first descend and walk around the pier, appreciating the historical bridge and its history with the island. Then they arrive at the <i>"water monitoring lab"</i>, appreciating the <em>current</em> effort on water preservation on Ohio river. At last, the visitors ascend to the final gallery. The final gallery features practices around the world and future scenarios. As the floor becomes suddenly open, and the views widened, the visitors will gain a broader understanding and appreciation towards water preservation. <br><br>
    From the platforms along the riverside to the glass floor beside the gallery, the building incorporates a variety of features that encourages visitors to <b>interact with the river</b>. The design provides both subtle teases, like the <a href="#" data-featherlight="./../webpage-imgs/threads/Model10.png">gaps</a> between the floors, and full-on open views, where the entire river becomes the backdrop for the outdoor theater.
