  <h2>INTENT</h2>
  <div>
    <p>In this project, our team developed a <b>mobile application prototype</b> for <b>peer-to-peer teaching</b>. In this app, other than the conventional monetary payment, students can also pay for lessons by teaching back. <br><br>
      This assignment was a second part to a previous project in which we were assigned different prompts to conduct <a href="tool-lending-user-study.htm">primary user/market research</a>. Each group then switched their research packets with another group to continue the app prototyping. After going over the research data, and conducting some additional interviews, we decided that our <b>three main goals</b> are:<br><br>
      <span class="li">1. Improving <em>mutual trust</em> between teachers and students. In real life, mutual teaching happens mostly <b>among friends</b>. We have to build on that to make the idea work with a lot of users.</span>
      <span class="li">2. Encouraging people to <em>verify and prove their expertise</em>. People are more willing to learn from a stranger, if he/she is very <b>knowledgable</b>. </span>
      <span class="li">3. Incentivizing individuals to <em>accept lessons as a payment</em>. It is to be expected that most people would want to receive real money. But we hope to bring our own impact and promote a community that encourages mutual teaching for people from all backgrounds.</span><br>
    After going through this process of synthesizing the problem space of peer-to-peer teaching, we quickly generated and merged personas and scenarios to illustrate our findings, and to help move forward with the design process.<br><br></p>

        <h3>Retail Salesperson</h3>
        <p>Bernice is a retail salesperson. She has a <b>flexible schedule</b> and is eager to learn more graphic design skills to help her career development. She wishes to take some freelance jobs in her spare time and potentially become a graphic designer. However, she <b>doesn’t have a lot of money to spare</b> to pay for personal tutoring; and she finds online video courses <b>ineffective</b>, since there’s <b>no feedback or suggestions</b>. She is considering requesting lessons from her high school friends, some of whom are now graphic designers. In return, she is willing to pay as much as she can afford, and also <b>willing to teach cooking</b>, as she is a great cook and has many excellent family recipes. However she isn’t sure how much free time they might have to teach her with their busy schedules.</p>

He <b>loves teaching</b> because helping people brings him a sense of achievement, but after being a part-time tutor for 2 years, Eric is a little <b>tired of the one-way relationship</b>. He wishes to know his learners, make friends with them, as well as learn new subjects from them, as he has started to realize that all of his current friends are also from Google and rarely talk about anything else than work.</p>

          <h2>Bartering Scenario (Katie)</h2>
          <p>Bernice, a retail salesperson, has been trying to learn about graphic design, but cannot afford to pay for professional classes. However, she is quite a talented cook and would be willing to teach cooking instead of necessarily a full class payment. Using TeachMe, Bernice is able to enter what classes she wants to take (graphic design) and what classes she can teach (cooking) and finds a good match, Sarah. Since Sarah is teaching a seven class graphic design program but Bernice’s cooking class is only four classes, Sarah and Bernice use TeachMe to barter such that Bernice teaches Sarah and only pays $50, well within Bernice’s budget. Using TeachMe, Bernice is able to finally begin to explore her interests and not go over her budget.

          <p>Michael, a middle aged lawyer, has always wanted to learn about drawing; unfortunately, between his job and his young family, he has never been able to find the time to take a weekly class at the local community college, as his schedule changes based on the case he is working on that week. However, Michael discovers the app TeachMe, where he met Erica, an artist who teaches on TeachMe as a side gig. With the scheduling app in TeachMe, Michael is able to schedule classes week by week whenever he is free based on Erica’s availabilities and is finally able to learn how to draw.</p>

          <p>Mackenzie used to metalwork with her mother as a child, and now, as an adult, wants to get back into the art. However, whenever she looks for local or online classes, the classes are too introductory; Mackenzie more than once has signed up for a class only to realize that she knows the material already. However, she discovers TeachMe, where she finds Robert, a chemical engineer who metalworks in his free time. Although he also offers an intro class, Mackenzie sees that he is also offering an advanced class, which finally seems to cover some of the more advanced techniques she wanted to learn. Finally, Mackenzie is able to improve her skills in metalworking.</p>

          <h2>Class Reviews Scenario (Sarika)</h2>
          <p>Philip is a retired pastry chef who often teaches and tutors for some extra income to supplement his retirement money. He has often run into the issue with several tutoring apps where his classes are posted next to an amateur baker; he feels like he could be getting a lot more business if potential students could see the difference in the quality of the class session. However, once he signed up on TeachMe, his classes are always filled, as his students have been sharing photos of the intricate desserts they are now able to create. His students also leave very positive ratings and comments, which has helped boost Philip’s business.</p>

    <h2>PROTOTYPING AND USER TESTING</h2>
    <p>With our storyboards complete, we created a low fidelity navigation map to help plan out the user interaction with our application. 
    We started creating low fidelity wireframes of the application to start basic <b>user testing</b>. We chose a very simple low-fidelity black and white format for the screens in order for us to get the most feedback from user testing. We were able to develop a <b>10 screen clickthrough</b> that tested how a learner might register, look through available classes, select a cooking class, examine bartering options, and finally request and be approved for a class.<br><br>
    Some of the problems we encountered:
    <span class="li">We want the registeration to be quick, but we also want to encourage users to upload materials for their expertise, which is quite boring and arduous.</span>
    <span class="li">In a lot of the screens, we were offering too many options, which made the design a little confusing.</span>
    <span class="li">We were not sure about how to deal the varying degrees of willingness: e.g. A user might only want to pay with classes, but doesn't want to make his classes public to everyone.</span>

  <h2>SCREEN DESIGN</h2>
    <p>After the user testing round, we tweaked our prototypes, and we were ready to actually design the screens in much more detail. From the start, we developed a <b>mood board</b> to capture the <i>"feelings"</i> of the application. We wanted to emphasize <b>warm and inviting</b> colors, as long as <b>chill and relaxed colors</b>, going for a set of yellows and blues for our app design.<br><br>
    Using our mood board as inspiration, we were able to generate a <b>style sheet</b> that would dictate the aesthetics of our application. We all decided to focus on the <b>yellow color theme</b>, which sparked an idea for the app name: “eggschange.” Not only does this name have a playful ring on the exchange of knowledge occurring in our peer-to-peer app, but “eggschange” gave us a chance to create an egg logo that would add a whimsical flair to our design.<br><br>
    For our final screen designs, we were careful to create <b>consistency</b> across the screens, while still created compelling and unique designs. We also made sure to <b>incorporate feedback</b> from our user testing results, which led to major changes in how we presented the bartering or “eggschange” part of the application. We were also careful to keep the egg theme across the application for the touch of whimsy and humor to help people feel more comfortable while using the app. </p>
